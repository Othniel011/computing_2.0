    <h1>Elyon Student Regulation:</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h3>This Student Regulations have been carefully prepared to help you understand the
        standards, values, and expectations that guide our school community. It outlines
        important school policies, academic guidelines, behavioral expectations, and
        student responsibilities designed to help you grow not only in knowledge but also
        in character and faith.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>As a school that upholds the motto “To Be Victorious Leadersin Christ,” we believe
        that true success comes from a heart transformed by God and a life committed to
        His purpose. Through every subject, activity, and relationship, we pray you will be
        equipped to lead with integrity, serve with compassion, and shine His light
        wherever you go.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>We encourage you to read this regulation carefully and refer to it throughout the
        year. Let it be a tool to guide your journey toward becoming the person God has
        called you to be both in school and beyond. May this year be filled with learning,
        growth, and God's abundant grace.</h3>
